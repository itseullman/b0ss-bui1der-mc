As Staff, we can provide replacements ONLY IF we are notified BEFORE testing that you wish to have replacement items ready in the event of total item lose, which will be unlikely. You also agree to never release ANY info about the testing to the general server. This includes boss names, weapons, drops, visuals, minions, mechanics, arena specifics, etc. You can be exempt from parts of this node if permission is expressed by Staff.
